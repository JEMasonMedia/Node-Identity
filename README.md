# Node-Identity

Node-Identity is a library meant to emulate the hugely popular "ASP.Net Identity" library for the Node environment. This library will contain a fully functioning Authentication and Authorization mechanism for React, using Next.js page components for the Register/Login functionality and User Profile management, as well as a client component library for Redux integration. Later versions of this library will include actual "ASP.Net Identity" integration, multiple methods of multi-factor authentication, and integration with B2C, Microsoft Live, Google Auth services, and many others.

## Purpose

Through my research, I found that there are many various options for authentication libraries, but very few as easy to implement out of the box as "ASP.Net Identity." This surprised me in a very real way. With the open source community that Node has, why isn't there something as easy as Identity available, equally as robust, that one can use with a simple "npm i asdf", and a little configuration. So I decided to create it myself.

### Contribution

As this is an open source project, utilizing other open source libraries, and that I am not yet as professional programmer, I am absolutely welcome to the communities contributions to this project. It's definitely not a single coder job to build what I'm hoping to be a project library used across the entire internet. And being an open source project, there is no reason this couldn't end up one of the most secure authentication options available.
